        <h2 id='title'>on adventure in one's life</h2>
        <div class='paging'>
            <p>If you see life as a journey, or an adventure, then it's easier to imagine how living in the past used to be much better. Risking your life for a purpose ended in either success or death, very rarely did anyone just give up. In the present it is much more dificult because death is no longer an option. Failure in achieving the goal is a thing you have to live with for your whole life. Even picking the goal means you give up the security that comes with integrating into society and living on a job. If you pick your own path, it is possible that when you fail, you will not be able to integrate, leaving you on the streets or some other sorry shape. There are no incentives for anyone to choose their own path. Even the people seen as adevnturous today only juggle a little with the normal road.</p>
            <p>What would a compeltely new road look like? What would someone who gave up competely on what society dictates and chose to pursue their own path look like? How valueble would they be? How many things have we missed because they do not exist? I hope, in my life, I am able to be at least 5% as adeveturous as I should be, otherwise what's the point?</p>
